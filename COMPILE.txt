LINUX:
    * Create a build directory (if creating the build directory within the project directory, call it 'build' so that it is recognized by .gitignore).
    * Enter the new build directory.
    * Call cmake /path/to/CMakeLists.txt
    * Call make in the build directory.

WINDOWS
    * Create a build directory (if creating within the project directory, call it 'build-vs' to have it be ignored by git)
    * Enter the new build directory.
    * Call cmake /path/to/CMakeLists.txt from a shell (e.g. git shell)
    * Open the generated solution and build all.


EXAMPLE

Having the following project structure:

audio_project/
    CMakeLists.txt
    ... source files and stuff ...

Create a 'build' or a 'build-vs' directory (build in this example):

audio_project/
    build/
    CMakeLists.txt
    ... source files and stuff ...

cd into build. Call 'cmake ..'. On Linux, call 'make' to compile. On Windows, open the generated Visual Studio solution and hit build solution.
